1.the reason for the significant time difference between the copy and move operations
- With dynamic allocation memory, the copy operations speed is slower than the move operations speed.
  Copy operations are working for making a full copy of string including allocation of another array in
  dynamic memory, while Move operations are working for only transfer value of pointer itself to another
  one and are removed itself address. So, They have different time to work.

2. I have learned about move constructor and move operator. It seem like copy Constructor and operator but I should
   understand Rvalue and '&&'. It is easy to understand and I can use immediately. Most hard part is the counting of
   words. I should understand 'ifstream' because I needed to count words from file. I searched a lot and I tried
   various medtods. It was good challenge and I have confidence that I can use again. Also It was difficult of time
   count. I didn't know this before also I studied a lot of this, but Actually I couldn't understand all. I just
   Followed Intruction.
   
Quiz 2 reflection
- question 2 : I didn't describe pure virtual function what each does, I just wrote that we need 'virtual' and '=0'.
- Answer : 'Virtual' term indicates that this is a virtual function compared to the basic function. And 'virtual function =         0' tells the compiler that this function only exists as a name/identifier to be referenced but wonâ€™t have any           implementation
